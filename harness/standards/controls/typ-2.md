## Requirement

Set body copy at 14px or larger in Inter, UI labels at 11px or larger, and body
line-height between 1.5 and 1.6. Sizes come from the TFX type scale (TYP-3); this
control sets the floors.

## Rationale

Readability is kindness. Teachers scan between classes — already tired, already
behind. Type below these floors trades their legibility for layout convenience, which
inverts Utility by Default.

## Passes when

- All body copy is ≥ 14px (Body Small is the 14px floor; Body 16, Body Large 18).
- Labels and captions are ≥ 11px (Label 11 / Caption 12 styles).
- Body text line-height computes to 1.5–1.6.

## Fails when

- Body copy below 14px — including "just this dense table".
- UI labels below 11px.
- Line-height under 1.5 on body copy.

## How to verify

`checks/type-scan` (planned): walk computed styles for text nodes; report any below
the floors with selector and computed size. Until the script exists, verify manually
against rendered output and label it "verified manually".
