name: design
description: Design or change a product UI in a DXD portfolio — a new page, screen, form, flow, OR a modification to an existing one (adding a field, editing copy, restyling a component). Use whenever the user asks to design, create, build, add to, change, fix, or restyle any page, screen, form, component, or user flow — and whenever they ask to re-audit, re-check, or re-verify an existing page against the standards catalog (e.g. after the catalog gains new controls). Orchestrates the full loop — intent, diverge, plan (human gate), implement, verify — with the TFX-DS standards catalog enforced throughout. For copy-only edits the copy skill is sufficient; for questions about the catalog itself use standards; and to review, improve, or polish an existing page with no specific change named — or when the user just says they don't like it — use critique.

# Design UI

You are designing UI for a product in your portfolio. The normative source is the DXD
Design Standard (historical source: TFX-DS). The product's brand — its primary colours,
typography, voice, and brand essence — resolves from context: the product's `DESIGN.md`,
else its domain profile (`standards/domains/<domain>.yaml`), else the foundation default.
The always-on test: does this help your users get their task done faster with less
stress? If not, don't build it. *(Teachers & School binding: the portfolio is Teacher
Workspace, CaseSync, Glow, and TW surfaces; brand essence is **Kind Utility** — useful
first, kind at the surface, and the test names teachers — see
`standards/domains/teachers-school.yaml`.)* Standards compliance is not a
final check — it shapes every phase. Work through the phases in order; do not skip a
gate even if the request seems simple.

The harness's one promise: **intent without loss**. What the builder means is written
down as a contract in Phase 1; every later phase is graded against that contract;
drift from it is a defect.

<!-- tfx-sync:L0 source=catalog -->
**Non-negotiables (L0), binding even outside the loop:** AA contrast (A11Y-1); keyboard
reach with visible focus (A11Y-2); a visible label on every field (A11Y-3); destructive
actions show consequences and offer undo or confirm (CMP-2).
<!-- /tfx-sync:L0 -->
These never bend — if one
seems impossible, that is a blocking question for the user, not a judgment call. (The
catalog carries the rest; these four are restated here because this SKILL.md travels in
the plugin while the harness's CLAUDE.md does not.)

**Load first:** the control catalog at `standards/catalog.yaml`. **Locating it:** the
catalog ships with this harness, not with the product repo — resolve it relative to
this SKILL.md file, three levels up: `<this-skill-dir>/../../../standards/catalog.yaml`
(the same path works in the harness dev repo and when installed as the
`tfx` plugin; do not expect `standards/` in the project cwd). Filter
controls by `phase` and scope (`products`/`audiences` — absent = global) as you
go; read a control's `detail` file (same `standards/`
directory) before applying it. Also read the product's `DESIGN.md` (repo root)
if present — per-product parameters only; on conflict with implemented code
conventions, the code wins and you flag the drift. Spec: the harness's
`docs/DESIGN-CONTEXT.md`. Also load the `standards` skill for the waiver
protocol. For any waiver or applicability question read
`../../../standards/README.md` — never answer from memory.

**The stack.** The foundation demands token-shaped behaviour (TOK-1..3) but names no
stack, typeface, or primary — resolve those from context: the product's `DESIGN.md`,
else its domain profile (`standards/domains/<domain>.yaml`), else the foundation
default. Each product anchors primary actions and brand moments in its **own** primary
(COL-1). Build from the resolved system by default — deliberately boring and AI-legible
beats invented. *(Teachers & School binding, from `standards/domains/teachers-school.yaml`:
Base UI components, Radix Colors scales, shadcn/ui default tokens for spacing/radius/type;
Plus Jakarta Sans (600) display, Inter (400/500/600) body/UI; per-product primaries —
Teacher Workspace → T&S Blue `#0064FF`, Glow → orange, CaseSync → indigo, see COL-1's
detail file for the table.)*

**Judgment lens.** Where no control decides and the product's brand essence alone is too
coarse, weigh trade-offs against Apple's HIG design principles (Purpose, Agency,
Responsibility, Familiarity, Flexibility, Simplicity, Craft, Delight —
developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/design-principles). A
reference point like SGDS and GOV.UK, never a checkable standard: principles settle
trade-offs; they are not used to "check" work. The phase notes below name the ones
that recur in this portfolio.

**Layout controls.** Layout has seven controls: LAY-1 (the product's declared
column grid and gutter scale — N/A where no grid is declared in `.dxd/design.json`
`layout_system` (fall back to `.tfx/design.json` in repos that predate the rename);
L2), LAY-2 (reflow at 320 px — WCAG 2.2 SC 1.4.10, L1), LAY-3
(page-template fit, L2), LAY-4 (body-text measure ≤ 80ch, target ~66ch — L2),
LAY-5 (density fits the task, L2), LAY-6 (edge / optical alignment, L2), and
LAY-7 (one primary focal region; visual reading order matches the task's
priority order — L2).

## New page vs. modification

This loop covers both. Choose the entry depth by change size, never skip the gates:

- **New page or flow** — run all six phases.
- **Modification** (add a field, change a layout region, restyle a component) — run a
  scoped loop: a one-line intent, skip diverge if the structure is fixed, a short plan
  naming the controls the *changed surface* pulls in, then implement and verify the
  changed surface. A modification still binds its controls — adding a field still
  triggers A11Y-3, restyling still triggers TOK-1..3, touching an async action still
  triggers CMP-3. The common failure is treating "just add a field" as outside the
  harness; it is not.
- **Catalog update re-audit** — when controls are ADDED to the catalog, existing
  shipped surfaces are silently out of date until re-audited. Run each affected
  surface through the modification loop: the "change" is the catalog delta, the
  scoped plan is the audit findings against the new controls only.

### Existing surfaces: critique before you polish

Whenever the surface **already exists** and the ask is broader than a narrowly
scoped named change (a restyle, an "improve / polish this", or a catalog
re-audit), the evaluate step belongs to the `critique` skill — **invoke
`critique` first** and continue here once the user approves its suggestions. Do
not propose changes before the current state has been captured and judged. The
critique captures the live page, runs a structured layout read (against
`../critique/layout-patterns.md`), grades it against the in-scope catalog
controls and the product's brand essence, and returns ranked suggestions whose "what
underperforms" list sets the scope of the polish; the procedure lives in
`../critique/critique.md`. **Preserved is not waived** — a "preserve" call still
has to pass its controls, it only means don't restyle a deliberate choice.

## A flow is not a stack of pages

The page is the unit of evidence, but the design is the journey. When the surface is
a flow — or a single page hosts a multi-step interaction — design the journey, not
just each screen:

- **Map it in Phase 1**: entry points (where does the user arrive from, and with
  what already known?), the done state, and every exit — back, cancel, abandon. A
  flow with only its happy path mapped is a demo, not a design.
- **Edge cases are structure, not polish.** Decide in Phase 3, not during build:
  interruption (timeout, network loss mid-flow), partial completion and resume, the
  user who left at step 2 and returns tomorrow, data that already exists
  elsewhere. For each, the plan says what happens to the user's work — "your
  draft is saved" must be a designed behaviour before it can be honest copy.
- **Interactions carry the flow.** Transitions preserve context — content and
  controls stay in predictable positions across steps (HIG: Flexibility); keyboard
  traversal works across the whole journey, not just within each screen (A11Y-2 at
  flow scope); focus lands somewhere sensible after every step change (A11Y-11
  applies at each transition, not only at async states).
- **Escapability is part of the structure** (HIG: Agency): the user can leave at
  any step without losing work, and the route out is visible, not discovered.

## What actually runs today

Not every deterministic control has a script yet, and every built script covers only a
**static subset** of its control — never assume a control is mechanically enforced.
**Never report a `checks/`-backed control as "passed" when no script ran** — say
"verified manually" or "could not verify mechanically", and list what a human should
re-check. Which scripts exist and exactly what each does *not* cover: `checks/README.md`
(read it before the verify phase).

## Phase 1 — Intent (sprint contract)

### Clarify the ask before you scope it

A request like "apply the standards", "improve this", "polish it", or "make it
better" names *no dimension of change* — and you cannot infer one, so do not try.
"Apply the standards" in particular reads by default as a **compliance + anti-slop
pass**: on a surface that is already decent, that can finish with the visuals looking
almost unchanged. That is exactly what disappointed the Glow pilot (a Teachers & School
product) — the builder wanted a brand-forward visual redesign, said "apply the
standards", and got a run that tightened UX the surface had mostly got right already. The fix is not to guess bigger;
it is to **ask**. When the request is open-ended, use a structured `AskUserQuestion`
to pin down which **dimension(s)** are in scope:

- **Visual & brand expression** — colour, type expression, imagery, the surface's
  energy, and how strongly it carries the product's brand (for Teachers & School:
  Glow's warmth, TW's blue, CaseSync's indigo). This is the dimension "apply the
  standards" silently drops.
- **Layout & structure** — hierarchy, composition, page template, density.
- **UX & flow** — the user's path, the steps, the states, the friction.
- **Copy** — headings, labels, microcopy, error states.
- **Compliance & anti-slop only** — fix control violations, change nothing that is
  deliberate. This is the *narrowest* ask; confirm it is what the builder meant
  rather than the default they fell into.

Pair the dimensions with an **ambition level** — the smallest reversible change that
meets the contract (Phase 4's standing default), a targeted lift of the
underperforming parts, or a bold reimagining *within the product's existing system*
(never an invented aesthetic — COL-1, TYP-1, SLP-1 still bind). Standards compliance
is the floor in every case; this question decides whether the ceiling is in scope
too. Write the answer into the done-criteria so the evaluator grades against the
dimension the builder wanted, not the one the phrase defaulted to.

Establish the rest, asking the user only what you cannot infer:

> For an **existing** surface, run "Existing surfaces: critique before you polish"
> (above) before writing the contract — the contract's done-criteria should target the
> critique's findings *through the dimensions chosen above*, not a blanket redesign and
> not a compliance-only pass when the builder asked for more. ("Critique the current
> state first".)

1. **Purpose**: what must the user accomplish on this page? One sentence. Apply
   the one test: *does this help your users get their task done faster with less
   stress?* If not, raise that before designing anything. Keep the scope focused
   (HIG: Purpose): prioritise the few things this moment actually needs and make
   those truly good — a page with a clear use beats one that does everything.
2. **The user and the moment**: anchor in a specific person's real workflow, not
   an abstract "user" — can you name the person and the moment this serves? (For a
   Teachers & School surface: "Ms. Lim, P5 Math, entering marks the week before
   reports are due.") Design for the stressed week, not the average one.
3. **Product and page type**: which product (for Teachers & School: TW / CaseSync /
   Glow / TW surface — this sets tone calibration per `copy`), and what kind of surface: workspace
   view, form, flow step, dashboard, settings, empty state, onboarding. Page type
   selects controls via `applies_to`. **Audience**: who does this surface serve —
   the product's declared audience (its domain profile `audiences:` / `DESIGN.md`);
   if undeclared, ask — teachers, students (ask which band: primary, or secondary and
   up), or parents. Record it in the sprint contract;
   it scopes `audiences:`-scoped controls for the rest of the loop. If the product
   repo has a `DESIGN.md`, load it now — it calibrates colour/tone/motion for
   everything downstream. **Any
   surface with an async or destructive
   action inherits the `[flow]` controls** (CMP-2, CMP-3) even when it is a single
   page — do not let the page/flow split scope them out.
4. **Done-criteria**: write a short sprint contract — the 3–6 statements the evaluator
   will later grade against. State the **dimension(s) and ambition** chosen in "Clarify
   the ask" as explicit criteria (e.g. "the surface visibly carries the product's brand
   energy", not just "passes the standards") — otherwise the evaluator has no way to catch a run that
   delivered compliance when the builder wanted a visual redesign. Include the
   `intent`-phase controls (CNT-2 naming applies here: name the feature in plain
   language now, before a placeholder name spreads).
5. **Component inventory**: list the surface as a coverage checklist — the route,
   every component it renders (by import name), and every **interactive control**
   on it (buttons, inputs, dropdowns/combobox, toggles, tabs, links, menus). For
   each interactive control, name the states to exercise later: open, keyboard-tab
   (focus visible?), screen-read (role + accessible name + state?). This is the
   list Phase 5 checks off and the evaluator independently verifies — coverage is
   a provable checklist, not a vibe. (For an existing surface, build this during
   "Existing surfaces: critique before you polish".)

Output: the sprint contract, shown to the user.

## Phase 2 — Diverge

Produce 2–3 structurally different options. **No pixel code.** For each option:
layout structure, which existing components it composes, how the flow splits across
steps, a one-line **visual thesis** (the mood and energy it carries — stated as an
extension of the product's existing system, never an invented new aesthetic), and one
sentence on the trade-off. Use the product's component manifest
(`.tfx/component-manifest.json`, filtered to `status: "stable"` entries) —
options may only compose components that exist in the manifest (CMP-1 applies from
here on). If the product has no manifest yet, fall back to the v0-limit procedure
in `standards/controls/cmp-1.md` and note "asserted, no manifest".
Progressive disclosure is the default pattern: show the core path, reveal complexity
on demand. Three anti-slop controls bind at this altitude: a complex multi-section
task gets a page, never a modal (SLP-10) — if an option puts tabs, columns, or its
own scrolling inside a dialog, it is not an option; a grid of identical cards is
not a default layout (SLP-5) — structure should come from the task's hierarchy, not
a template; and a card is only for an interactive unit (SLP-11) — if an option boxes
static content in card chrome where spacing, type, and a divider would group it, that
is a finding, not a layout. Two lenses bind here too: simplicity is not minimalism (HIG: Simplicity) —
keep the important things close and let the rest fall away, never hide what the task
needs; and keep the user free to move (HIG: Agency) — an option that locks people
into a guided flow or mode must make it easy to skip or escape.

**Compose, don't fill.** Treat the first screen as a composition, not a container to
pack: one clear focal point — the user's primary task and its single primary action
(CMP-5) — with related content grouped by proximity and a shared region rather than
boxed in cards (SLP-11), and everything else stepped down so hierarchy does the
explaining (SLP-6). Each option's layout is graded at verify against LAY-3 (does it fit
a known page template for its type?), LAY-5 (does its density fit the task?), LAY-6
(do shared edges align?), and LAY-7 (one primary focal region; does the visual reading
order match the task's priority order — the squint test) — design to them now, not as
a cleanup pass. When diverging on an existing surface, the critique's layout
suggestions seed the options.

Output: the options with a recommendation. The user picks.

## Phase 3 — Plan (human gate)

Expand the chosen option into a plan:

- Page/step structure and the component for each region.
- Tokens/patterns used; any **missing component** surfaced explicitly with options
  (extend an existing Base UI component / request from the design system — never
  improvise a one-off without a CMP-1 waiver).
- **Interaction plan**: name the 2–3 specific motions the chosen option uses — one
  entrance, one state transition, one hover/reveal — described concretely (what moves,
  from what to what), not "add animations". Reuse the product's existing motion
  conventions; every motion is bound by MOT-1 (100–300ms, standard easing, none on
  critical paths beyond functional feedback), SLP-8 (no bounce/elastic), and A11Y-5
  (a reduced-motion variant). Motion that improves neither hierarchy nor feedback is cut.
- The controls in scope for this page (filtered catalog), with any proposed waivers
  and their rationale — waivers are decided here, not improvised during implementation.
- Content outline: headings, key copy, names checked against CNT-2, error states
  (CMP-3: enumerate loading/success/error states per async action — and for each
  state, its A11Y-11 announcement channel: live region or focus move; CMP-2: every
  destructive action's consequence + undo/confirm, decided now).
- **Flow map** (when the surface is a flow or hosts a multi-step interaction): entry
  points, done state, every exit, and the edge cases from "A flow is not a stack of
  pages" — interruption, partial completion, resume — each with what happens to the
  user's work. A plan that covers the steps but not the journey between them is
  incomplete.
- **Tradeoffs, named**: what this design sacrifices and why that's acceptable. A plan
  without a tradeoffs section is incomplete.
- **Plan summary table**: end the plan with a compact table the reader can scan in one
  pass — one row per plan dimension (structure; components; interaction & motion; async
  states + each one's A11Y-11 channel; controls in scope; waivers; tradeoffs; evidence
  to capture), each cell a tight phrase, not prose. It is a summary the grill and the
  approver read first, never a substitute for the plan above it.

**Stop. The user approves the plan before any implementation.** This is the cheapest
place for human judgment — structural mistakes caught here cost a conversation, not a
rebuild. The gate runs across **three stages**, in order — never collapsed on your own
initiative; only the human's clear early approval shortens it (`grill.md`'s
early-approval rule):

- **Stage 1 — expose the plan.** The full plan goes in your message body, ending with
  the plan summary table. Close with a plain-text line that you will grill the plan
  next — **never a modal/option dialog in the same turn as the plan**, which forces a
  decision before the reader has read what they're deciding on. Do not ask for
  approval yet.
- **Stage 2 — grill the plan.** Read `grill.md` (beside this skill) now and run it:
  interrogate the exposed plan one question at a time, each with a recommended answer,
  looking up facts from context and putting every open decision to the human, and
  folding every answer back into the plan before the next question. This is where hidden assumptions and
  ducked decisions get resolved, so the human approves a sharpened plan rather than a
  first draft. Grilling sharpens only: a question whose answer changes the chosen
  structure sends you back to Phase 2, and grilling never relaxes a control.
- **Stage 3 — the structured ask.** Once the grill is spent, ask for sign-off on the
  sharpened plan with a structured **Approve / Adjust** `AskUserQuestion` — the
  documented Phase-3 default. "Approve" proceeds to implement; "Adjust" sends you back
  to revise the plan — a structural adjustment returns to Phase 2 (the grill's own
  rule), anything else is re-exposed and re-asked. A free-text approval is still
  accepted; a vague "continue" is not — confirm what they are approving.

This structured **Approve / Adjust** question is the default at the Phase 2 option pick
and at continuation/verify gates too — but the three-stage split above is Phase 3 only.
At the Phase 2 pick the dialog may be same-turn, because the options are short enough
to read inside it. In an unattended run the grill has no human to answer it — grill
yourself and record it, per `grill.md`.

In an **unattended run** with no human reachable, proxy approval is
permitted only when the operator authorized it up front — record it verbatim as
"approved by operator proxy — unattended run" in the decision record, never as if a
human approved.

Proxy approval is not a substitute for review. In an unattended run, still emit a
**compact, reviewable plan + intended-diff summary** for async sign-off: the files
to be touched, the specific visual/structural changes, and — explicitly — what is
being **preserved**. Route it to the async reviewer (the portfolio designer) and
record that it was sent; do not treat "operator proxy" as equivalent to a human
having read the diff.

On a team with no dedicated designer, this gate (and the verify gate) is reviewed
async by a portfolio designer — route the plan to them rather than treating the gate
as optional. Write the approved plan to a decision record at `docs/decisions/<page>.md` in
the **product repo**. If `docs/decisions/TEMPLATE.md` does not yet exist there,
copy it from the plugin first — it ships at
`<this-skill-dir>/../../../docs/decisions/TEMPLATE.md` (resolved the same way as
the catalog in the Load-first note, three levels up) — so records conform to
`audit-record.py` by default. Base the new record on that template. The approved
plan is the artifact the verify phase grades against, so it must be fixed, not
whatever you last proposed. Any L1 waiver granted here records its named approver
in that file.

## Phase 4 — Implement

Build exactly the approved plan. Constraints, non-negotiable:

- **Conservative, reversible defaults — do not restyle what is already
  deliberate.** Established iconography, corner radius, layout structure, and
  settled copy are presumed intentional: do not change them as a side effect of a
  scoped task. If a change to one is genuinely warranted, flag it explicitly as a
  *proposed* change with its rationale and a one-line revert note in the plan/diff
  summary — never silently. Default to the smallest reversible change that meets
  the contract. **But preserved is not waived:** "deliberate" protects an element's
  *look* from restyling, never its *compliance* from verification. A preserved avatar,
  badge, or icon still must pass A11Y-1 (contrast), A11Y-2/-3, and every in-scope
  control; if it fails one, fixing it is in scope — flag the fix as above rather than
  leave the failure standing because the element was "established". (Example:
  per-section semantic colour-coded icons that are decorative `aria-hidden` wayfinding
  are **not** SLP-1 "rainbow slop" — preserve them; neutralising them is a restyle to
  flag, not a default.)
- Compose only manifest components (`status: "stable"` from `.tfx/component-manifest.json`
  if the product has one; CMP-1); semantic shadcn tokens only — no raw
  colour, off-scale spacing, or off-scale radii (TOK-1..3); the product's resolved
  typefaces only (TYP-1; Teachers & School: Plus Jakarta Sans / Inter), on-scale sizes
  (TYP-2..3).
- Functional colours come from the Radix scales (COL-2); **small functional-colour
  text (≤12px) on a tint uses step-12, not step-11** — step-11 on a tint dips below
  the 4.5:1 AA floor (A11Y-1).
- Visible label on every field (A11Y-3); keyboard reach + focus states (A11Y-2);
  AA contrast (A11Y-1); targets ≥ 24px, 44px on mobile (A11Y-4); respect reduced
  motion (A11Y-5).
- Anti-slop is standard (SLP-1..11) — the default AI aesthetic is a defect. The
  rules live in the catalog you loaded first; re-read the SLP block before
  styling anything. Highest-frequency traps: purple/violet gradients (SLP-1),
  nested cards (SLP-4), identical-card grids (SLP-5), bounce easing (SLP-8).
- Accessibility structure (A11Y-6..10, GovTech Essential tier) — apply from
  the catalog; every image/icon, heading, custom control, page title, and
  landmark is in scope.
- Every async state change picks ONE announcement channel (A11Y-11): transient →
  live region, no focus steal; context replacement → focus moves to the revealed
  surface, no `role="alert"` on the focus target. Declare the channel per state in
  the Phase 3 plan alongside CMP-3's state enumeration.
- Destructive actions: consequence + undo/confirm before execution (CMP-2, L0).
  Build forgiveness beyond CMP-2's minimum (HIG: Agency): recovering from the
  unexpected should not cost the user time or work — preserve drafts, keep
  back-navigation safe, make reversal cheap.
- Consistency is a feature (HIG: Familiarity, Flexibility): once an element's
  behaviour or appearance is established, reuse it across the surface, and keep
  content and controls in predictable positions across the three widths — people
  learn faster when new interactions work the way the last one did. **Use
  design-system components at their defaults and the way sibling pages use them
  (CMP-7): an override that changes a default's colour/contrast/shape, or a control
  group whose members don't share a resting affordance, is a finding unless recorded
  with a reason — re-check any colour/contrast override under A11Y-1.**
- **Action hierarchy** (CMP-5): one primary (filled) action per view — secondary steps
  down to outline/tonal, tertiary to ghost/link; a destructive action takes its own
  variant, never the primary style (CMP-2). The primary's colour is the product's own
  brand primary (COL-1). Make the next step obvious without a label.
- **Tables** (CMP-6): for tabular data — gradebooks, rosters, attendance — use a real
  `<table>` with `<th>` headers (A11Y-7); right-align numeric columns in tabular figures
  (TYP-5) and left-align text; keep the header visible while scrolling; design the empty
  and loading states (CMP-3); set density to the task (LAY-5); separate rows with spacing
  or hairline dividers, not nested-card chrome (SLP-4). If records are not compared across
  shared columns, a list or cards may fit better than a table (SLP-11).
- **Empty states** (CMP-4): whatever the surface, an empty state's heading and subtext
  must read as "nothing here yet" — never as still loading or as a permissions error —
  and no skeleton row, shimmer, or spinner may render alongside that heading.
- **Cross-user content** (CMP-9): where content authored by one user renders to a
  different user (a comment authored by one user shown to another, a message shown to
  another staff member), sanitise it at the render boundary — an allowlist sanitiser
  immediately before render. A "schema-constrained editor" claim at author time is not
  sufficient on its own; the guarantee must hold where the HTML actually reaches the
  other user's screen.
- **Identity**: product icons come only from the approved product-icon family (IDN-2,
  L1); copy carries the product's calibrated tone register (IDN-3, L2); on CaseSync
  surfaces, casework is treated as sensitive — no celebration/gamification around case
  data (IDN-4, L1, CaseSync-scoped).
- **Interface craft** (HIG: Craft) — the small details that read as care: tabular
  figures, concentric radius, property-scoped interruptible transitions, press
  feedback, hit-area expansion, feels-instant loading, layered shadows, type polish,
  image edges, and disciplined `will-change`. Each refines the controls above, none
  replaces them, and the evaluator grades Craft on them. Apply the ones the surface
  calls for **from `implement-craft.md`** (beside this skill) as you build — the
  specifics live there so this list stays scannable; don't defer them to a cleanup pass.
- Copy follows the `copy` skill as you write it, not as a cleanup pass
  (it ships with this harness: `../copy/SKILL.md` relative to this skill).
  That includes the anti-slop copy rule (SLP-9): no AI-writing tells — buzzwords,
  em-dash chains, filler, chatbot artifacts, structural tells (negative
  parallelism, forced triads, copula avoidance), or label/helper pairs that
  restate each other. Canonical lists and calibration:
  `standards/controls/slp-9.md` — resolved relative to this SKILL.md (three levels up),
  as in the Load-first note above.
- **Make every asserted state reachable for evidence.** If a hybrid control claims
  loading/success/error states, the verify phase must photograph them — build a
  clearly-marked demo-only hook where needed (e.g. a `?fail=1` query param to force
  the error state) and note it in the decision record. A state that can't be
  demonstrated can't be verified.
- Structure drift from the approved plan is a defect — if implementation reveals the
  plan was wrong, go back to the user, don't silently improvise.

## Phase 5 — Verify

Run the four steps in `verify.md` (beside this skill) IN ORDER — read it now,
before verifying anything. Do not present output to the user while a step is
failing.

- Deterministic controls run first; an L0 failure blocks everything, an L1
  failure sends you back to Phase 4 — see "What actually runs today" above for
  what the scripts do and don't cover.
- Evidence sets are required: widths, states, journey (with a recovery path),
  the Phase-1 inventory checkoff, and the dark-mode N/A rule when the product
  has no dark mode.
- The evaluator verdict is written by the spawned `evaluator` agent, never by
  you, and is pasted verbatim into the decision record.

## Phase 6 — Ratchet

After the user accepts the result, finish the decision record started in Phase 3
(`docs/decisions/<page>.md`): chosen option, rejected options and why, waivers granted
and by whom, and the verify verdict. Then:

- Any failure the evaluator or user caught that no control covered → propose a new
  control or anti-pattern entry for `standards/`. Follow the "Growing the catalog"
  section of the `standards` skill — it is the single authoritative description
  of the proposal format.
- Harness friction the run surfaced that is **not** a control gap — a confusing step, a
  missing/unbuilt check, a process or onboarding nit — is filed as a GitHub issue via the
  `feedback` skill (it carries the procedure; `docs/harness-feedback.md` is the spec).
