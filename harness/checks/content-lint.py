Content lint — checks/content-lint.py
Scans UI source and content files for the statically-resolvable subset of
CNT-1, CNT-3, CNT-5, CNT-6, CNT-13, and the deterministic (lint) half of SLP-9 —
the parts detectable from source text alone, without rendered layout or human
judgement.

The SLP-9 word lists, the CNT-5 device-verb list, the CNT-6 opener/filler lists,
and the CNT-13 spelling maps are NOT embedded here. They are read at runtime from
standards/controls/slp-9.md, cnt-5.md, cnt-6.md, and cnt-13.md (resolved relative
to this file), so the lint and the catalog can never diverge — if a list grows,
this check picks it up. If a file cannot be found or parsed, the check falls back
to a small embedded copy and prints a NOTE saying so — never silently.

Detection rules (line-local only)
──────────────────────────────────
Rule            Control   What is caught
BUZZWORD        SLP-9     A word-boundaried, case-insensitive hit on the
                (L2)      buzzword list or the AI-vocabulary list, read from
                          slp-9.md (e.g. streamline, empower, supercharge,
                          delve, robust, foster, testament).
FILLER          SLP-9     A case-insensitive hit on the filler-phrase list
                (L2)      ("in order to", "it is important to note", …).
CHATBOT         SLP-9     A case-insensitive hit on the chatbot-artifact list
                (L2)      ("great question", "i hope this helps", "certainly!",
                          …).
EM-DASH         SLP-9     Two or more em dashes (—) inside a single sentence.
                (L2)
CNT-3           CNT-3     A user-facing string literal / MDX prose line whose
                (L2)      longest sentence exceeds 25 words.
CNT-1           CNT-1     A user-facing string that is ONLY a raw error code
                (L1)      (e.g. "ERR_SYNC_500", "0x80004005", an all-caps
                          token), or the literal "Something went wrong" with no
                          actionable next step on the same or next line.
CNT-5           CNT-5     A device-bound action verb (click, tap, swipe, and
                (L2)      inflections) inside a multi-word user-facing string or
                          MDX prose line, read from cnt-5.md. Names the input
                          device instead of the action.
CNT-6           CNT-6     A low-informational-value word in a user-facing string
                (L2)      or MDX prose line, read from cnt-6.md: a sentence-
                          INITIAL empty opener ("There is", "There are", "It is",
                          "This is") or a safe-subset filler word (just, really,
                          very, please) at any position.
CNT-13          CNT-13    A US spelling or common misspelling in a multi-word
                (L2)      user-facing string or MDX prose line, read from
                          cnt-13.md (color→colour, organize→organise,
                          recieve→receive). Suggests the British / correct form.

What this script does NOT verify
─────────────────────────────────
- Non-literal / interpolated strings: a `{variable}`, template literal with
  `${…}`, or string built by concatenation cannot be resolved statically. These
  are NOT flagged for CNT and NOT passed silently — they are out of static reach
  and the manual / evaluator pass covers them.
- Whether a string is truly user-facing vs. an internal label, key, className,
  import path, or test fixture. The CNT rules use conservative heuristics; when
  unsure, they do not flag. SLP-9 token hits are flagged regardless of position
  (a buzzword in a comment is already stripped; one in code is still a tell).
- CNT-3's "leads with its purpose" SEMANTIC half — that the copy opens with what
  it does rather than the mechanism — needs judgement. This check only counts
  sentence length. The evaluator judges voice, person, and lead-with-purpose.
- SLP-9's STRUCTURAL-TELL evaluator half — negative parallelism, forced triads,
  copula avoidance, significance inflation, redundant label/helper pairs,
  em-dash CLUSTERING across a paragraph (vs. two dashes in one sentence) — all
  need judgement. This check is the deterministic word-list + em-dash-chain lint
  half only.
- CNT-1's "what happened → what it means → what to do next" structure — the
  evaluator judges the full anatomy; this check only catches the raw-code-only
  and bare-"Something went wrong" cases.
- CNT-5's harder half — "press" and "see" (too common in innocent prose to lint
  cleanly), ambiguous link text ("click here", "read more"), and confirming a hit
  is a UI instruction rather than incidental prose ("press release", "tap water").
  This check lints only the unambiguous device verbs; the evaluator judges the rest.
- CNT-6's harder half — "such", "that", and droppable articles/conjunctions
  ("a", "the", "and") are far too context-dependent to lint (every "the" would be
  noise), and the clarity exception on every hit ("only if it does not reduce
  clarity") is judgement. "In order to" is deliberately NOT in the CNT-6 lint
  lists — SLP-9's filler-phrase list already flags it, and one token never fires
  two controls. This check lints only sentence-initial openers and the safe
  filler subset; the evaluator judges the rest.
